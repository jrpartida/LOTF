# Land of the Forgotten
In the Land of the Forgotten, three players control the Mexican guardian spirits of the afterlife in a 3rd-person hack and slash game to face off against one player, our villainous La Llorona, in a top-down, isometric strategy game. La Llorona places buildings, which spawn minions in the heroâ€™s path to stop them from reaching their lair.
